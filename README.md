## Miscellany
We chose the code of conduct because we believed it covered all we believed should be covered, gave fair chance for an honest mistake, but still able to give proper responses when needed. The license was chosen because it gives an open oppurtunity for as many people to use their own ideas and contribute as much as possible.
