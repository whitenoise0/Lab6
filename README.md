# Lab6: Birth Year Estimator

## Description
This program will give the user their estimated birth year.

## Usage
The program will prompt you to enter your name, then prompt you to enter how old you are. After submitting both, the program will print your name and estimating the year you were born in.

## Miscellany
We chose the code of conduct because we believed it covered all we believed should be covered, gave fair chance for an honest mistake, but still able to give proper responses when needed. The license was chosen because it gives an open oppurtunity for as many people to use their own ideas and contribute as much as possible.
